Project for solving algebraic problems with the following topics:

- [oalg-base](https://github.com/zErichGut/oalg-main/blob/main/oalg-base/README.md):
basic definitions and algorithms for algebras on oriented structures.

- [oalg-abg](https://github.com/zErichGut/oalg-main/blob/main/oalg-abg/README.md):
finitely generated abelian groups.

- [oalg-top](https://github.com/zErichGut/oalg-main/blob/main/oalg-top/README.md):
evaluating the homology groups of complexes.

- [omada](https://github.com/zErichGut/oalg-main/blob/main/omada/README.md):
interactive application to explore homology groups.
